# 📈 ZomatoData_Prediction using  — ML Algorithms

This project determines how to implement **ML Algorithm** to predict **Zomato Orders** based on their  **UserId**. The goal of this notebook is to accurately predict the data while optimizing the number of features used. In addition to achieving high accuracy, this notebook will explore whether similar evaluation metrics can be maintained with a distint feature set.

## 📂 Dataset

Complete Dataset consists of 1 CSV file.This CSV file has data which is related to Zomato. 

These files are mapped to  classify the set of data related to user and their orders.

## 🔧 Libraries Used

- `pandas` — Data loading and manipulation  
- `numpy` — Numerical operations  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — Data visualization  
- `sklearn` — Machine learning (model, training, evaluation)

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

1. **Import Libraries**  
2. **Upload and Read CSV Dataset**
3. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for null values  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Data visualization using seaborn  
5. **Train-Test Split**  
   - Using `train_test_split()`  
6. **Model Creation**  
   - Using scikit-learn  
7. **Prediction**  
   - Predicted users and their orders for test data  
8. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - F1_score 
   - Accuracy_score 
   - Precision_score  
   - Recall_score
   - Confusion_Matrix
9. **Visualization**  
   - plot of ** vs **

## 📊 Evaluation Output

```  
Accuracy_score ....
F1_score ..... 
precision_score .... 
recall_score .... 
```

This indicates a good accuracy prediction model.

## 📌 Visualization

A plot is generated to show the **UserID vs Posts** values with a reference bar:

- X-axis →  
- Y-axis →
